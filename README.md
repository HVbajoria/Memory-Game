# Memory-Game
Memory has long been a favorite game for all generations. It is easy to play,  It requires observation, concentration and a good memory to win.  So ready to play?
RULES :
At the beginning of the game, all the cards are mixed up and laid in rows, face down on the table.

Player 1 starts and turns over two cards:

If the cards don’t match (it’s not a pair), he turns them back over and it’s then the turn of player 2 to turn over two new cards.
However, if the two cards match, it’s a pair! He keeps the cards and has the right to play again...

When the players have found all the pairs, the game is over. The player who has the most cards wins!
 ARE YOU READY ??
